Measure cost of crossing protection boundaries:
1) NK call
  \ Kernel calling NestedKernel function
2) Syscall
  \ Userspace calling kernel function
3) VM hypercall
  \ Kernel calling into hypervisor
  -- TODO: Document how this experiment was performed!!
  Used custom bhyve, modified bhyveloader, custom 'kernel'
  for issuing VMCALL's, all need to be shared.


For '1', I've added code to the NK that
self-benchmarks a dummy NK function during kernel boot.
See "nk_bench.c".

For '2', dummy syscall benchmarked using userspace application.

For '3', same kernel benchmarking code as '1' but
calling dummy hypervisor function instead.
