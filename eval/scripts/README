<=== Software Building and Usage Description ===> 

    The scripts here are written in Ruby. In some instances they require extra
    dependencies. They use the R language for plotting. The required
    dependencies include:
        
        - rubygems
        - R language and interpreter
        - rserve: this is an inteface from ruby to R. It includes both a server
          daemon that runs on the machine with R and also requires a rubygem to
          be installed to interface.
